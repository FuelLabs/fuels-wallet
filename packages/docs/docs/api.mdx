## Methods

### Connect

`async connect(): Promise<boolean>`<br />
Request permission to start a connection between the project and the wallet

<CodeImport file="../../sdk/src/Fuel.test.ts" testCase="connect" />

### Disconnect

`async disconnect(): Promise<boolean>`<br />
Disconnect your project

<CodeImport file="../../sdk/src/Fuel.test.ts" testCase="disconnect" />

### Get connection status

`async isConnected(): Promise<boolean>`<br />
Return the state of the application connection.

<CodeImport file="../../sdk/src/Fuel.test.ts" testCase="isConnected" />

### List Accounts

`async accounts(): Promise<Array<string>>`<br />
List accounts in the wallet

<CodeImport file="../../sdk/src/Fuel.test.ts" testCase="accounts" />

### Current Account

`async currentAccount(): Promise<string>`<br />
Return the current account being used in the wallet application.

<CodeImport file="../../sdk/src/Fuel.test.ts" testCase="currentAccount" />

### Request signature message

`async signMessage(address: string, message: string): Promise<string>`<br />
Request a message signature for one specific account

<CodeImport file="../../sdk/src/Fuel.test.ts" testCase="signMessage" />

### Send transaction

`async sendTransaction(transaction: TransactionRequestLike): Promise<string>`<br />
Send a transaction, this will request the user selected account to review,
sign, and send the transaction.

<CodeImport file="../../sdk/src/Fuel.test.ts" testCase="sendTransaction" />

### Get Wallet

`getWallet(address: string | AbstractAddress): Promise<FuelWalletLocked>`<br />
Return `FuelWalletLocked` using a FuelWalletProvider on the connection point to request signed actions.

<CodeImport file="../../sdk/src/Fuel.test.ts" testCase="getWallet" />

### Get Provider

`getProvider(): Promise<FuelWalletProvider>`<br />
Return a FuelWalletProvider. This class extends the fuels-ts SDK's `Provider`,
enabling all of the methods available for `Provider` while using the FuelSDK on signature points to request user permissions.

Note: The provider returned is tied to the current network selected by the user in their wallet. This means that if the user changes the network within their wallet,
the DApp will also switch to that network. Support for specific DApp networks will be available in the future.

#### Using provider to query node info

<CodeImport file="../../sdk/src/Fuel.test.ts" testCase="getProvider" />

#### Using provider on a fuels-ts Wallet

<CodeImport
  file="../../sdk/src/Fuel.test.ts"
  testCase="User getProvider on fuels-ts Wallet"
/>

## Events

The Fuel client emits events when certain actions occur. These events can be listened to by using the `on` method.

### Usage

The `fuel` object has an `events` property which is an enum of all the events that can be listened to. <br />
The `on` method takes two arguments, the event name and a callback function. The callback function is passed the data associated with the event.

### Connection

Listen for a new connection to a node. Callback function receives the `connection` object.

```js
fuel.on(fuel.events.CONNECTION, async (connection) => {});
```

### Accounts

Listen for when the client connects his accounts. Callback function receives the `account` object.

```js
fuel.on(fuel.events.ACCOUNTS, async (accounts) => {});
```

### Current Account

Listen for when the current account is changed in the Fuel Wallet Extension. Callback function receives `account` address.

```js
fuel.on(fuel.events.CURRENT_ACCOUNT, async (account) => {});
```

### Network

Listen for when the client connects to a network. Callback function receives the `network` object.

```js
fuel.on(fuel.events.NETWORK, async (network) => {});
```
