# Getting Started
The Fuel Wallet SDK serves as a connection manager between your DApp and other wallets compatible with the Fuel Network. This package ensures that you can connect to the Fuel Wallet as well as any other wallet using a unified API.

If you are using **React** jump to the [React section](./#using-react).

## Installation

To begin integrating the Fuel Wallet SDK into your DApp, you first need to install the packages `@fuels/connectors` and `fuels`.

```bash
npm install fuels @fuels/connectors wagmi viem
```

The installation also requires the `fuels` SDK, as it is used to communicate with the Fuel Network and provides a set of utilities required for interacting with contracts on the Fuel Network.

Besides that, we also need to install the `@reown/appkit` to allow connection to Ethereum and Solana wallets.

```bash
npm install @reown/appkit @reown/appkit-adapter-wagmi @reown/appkit-adapter-solana @solana/wallet-adapter-wallets
```

This will allow developers and projects to choose and configure multiple blockchain networks within their instance of AppKit, extending beyond just Fuel (fuelVM) networks.

## Example

You can import `defaultConnectors` from `@fuels/connectors` to get a list of all the default connectors. Besides that, you can also create your own connectors or import them individually.

### Using default connectors
```ts
import { Fuel } from 'fuels';
import { defaultConnectors } from '@fuels/connectors';

const fuel = new Fuel({
  connectors: defaultConnectors({ devMode: true }),
});

await fuel.selectConnector('Fuel Wallet');
await fuel.connect();
```

### Using a custom list
```ts
import { Fuel } from 'fuels';
import { FuelWalletConnector } from '@fuels/connectors';

const fuel = new Fuel({
  connectors: [new FuelWalletConnector()],
});

await fuel.selectConnector('Fuel Wallet');
await fuel.connect();
```

## Using React

We also provide a set of React hooks and a user interface (UI) for seamless interaction with connectors, eliminating the need for manual UI creation.

### Installation

```bash
npm install fuels @fuels/connectors @fuels/react @tanstack/react-query wagmi viem
```

- [fuels](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts) is the SDK that provides a set of utilities for interacting with the Fuel Network.
- [@fuels/connectors](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-connectors) is the collection of connectors that allow you to connect to the Fuel Wallet.
- [@fuels/react](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-connectors/tree/main/packages/react) is a set of React hooks and a UI for seamless interaction with connectors.
- [@tanstack/react-query](https://github.com/tanstack/query) is a library for managing and caching data in React applications.
- [wagmi](https://github.com/wevm/wagmi) is a React library for Ethereum apps.
- [viem](https://github.com/wevm/viem) is a Typescript interface for Ethereum apps.

Besides that, we also need to install the `@reown/appkit` to allow connection to Ethereum and Solana wallets.

```bash
npm install @reown/appkit @reown/appkit-adapter-wagmi @reown/appkit-adapter-solana @solana/wallet-adapter-wallets
```

- [@reown/appkit](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit) is a SDK that allows you to connect to Ethereum and Solana wallets.
- [@reown/appkit-adapter-wagmi](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/tree/main/packages/adapters/wagmi) is a adapter for the Wagmi library.
- [@reown/appkit-adapter-solana](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/tree/main/packages/adapters/solana) is a adapter for the Solana Wallet Adapter.
- [@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter) is a modular TypeScript wallet adapters for Solana.

### Example

#### Setup

Wrap your application with the providers `QueryClientProvider` and `FuelProvider`.

```tsx
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';

import { createAppKit } from '@reown/appkit';
import { type AppKitNetwork, mainnet, solana } from '@reown/appkit/networks';
import { WagmiAdapter } from '@reown/appkit-adapter-wagmi';
import { SolanaAdapter } from '@reown/appkit-adapter-solana';

import { Provider, CHAIN_IDS, type FuelConfig } from 'fuels';
import { FuelProvider, type NetworkConfig } from '@fuels/react';
import { defaultConnectors } from '@fuels/connectors';

// 1. Setup queryClient
const queryClient = new QueryClient();

// 2. Setup Ethereum and Solana networks
const networks: [AppKitNetwork, ...AppKitNetwork[]] = [mainnet, solana];

// 3. Create Wagmi Adapter
const WC_PROJECT_ID = 'YOUR_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID';
const wagmiAdapter = new WagmiAdapter({
  networks,
  projectId: WC_PROJECT_ID,
});

// 4. Create Solana Adapter
const solanaAdapter = new SolanaAdapter();

// 5. Create AppKit
const appkit = createAppKit({
  adapters: [wagmiAdapter, solanaAdapter],
  enableWalletConnect: !!WC_PROJECT_ID,
  projectId: WC_PROJECT_ID,
  networks,
  features: {
    email: false,
    socials: false,
    analytics: false,
  },
});

// 6. Setup fuelConfig
const PROVIDER_URL = 'https://node.fuel.network/graphql';
const CHAIN_ID = CHAIN_IDS.fuel.mainnet;
const fuelConfig: FuelConfig = {
  connectors: defaultConnectors({ 
    devMode: true,
    chainId: CHAIN_ID,
    fuelProvider: Provider.create(PROVIDER_URL),
    appkit,
  }),
};

// 7. Setup fuelNetworks
const fuelNetworks: NetworkConfig[] = [
  {
    chainId: CHAIN_ID,
    url: PROVIDER_URL,
  },
];

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <WagmiProvider config={wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig}>
        <FuelProvider fuelConfig={fuelConfig} networks={fuelNetworks}>
          <App />
        </FuelProvider>
      </WagmiProvider>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

Alternatively, you can pass `ui={false}` to the `FuelProvider` to disable the UI in order to implement your own UI.

#### Usage

```ts
import { useConnectUI } from '@fuels/react';
const { connect, isConnecting } = useConnectUI();

<button onClick={connect}>
  {isConnecting ? 'Connecting...' : 'Connect'}
</button>
```
