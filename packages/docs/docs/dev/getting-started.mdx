# Getting Started

The Fuel Wallet SDK serves as a connection manager between your DApp and other wallets compatible with the Fuel Network. This package ensures that you can connect to the Fuel Wallet as well as any other wallet using a unified API.

If you are using **React** jump to the [React section](./#using-react).

## Installation

To begin integrating the Fuel Wallet SDK into your DApp, you first need to install the packages `@fuels/connectors` and `fuels`.

```bash
npm install fuels @fuels/connectors
```

The installation also requires the `fuels` SDK, as it is used to communicate with the Fuel Network and provides a set of utilities required for interacting with contracts on the Fuel Network.

## Example

You can import `defaultConnectors` from `@fuels/connectors` to get a list of all the default connectors. Besides that, you can also create your own connectors or import them individually.

### Using default connectors
```ts
import { Fuel } from 'fuels';
import { defaultConnectors } from '@fuels/connectors';

const fuel = new Fuel({
  connectors: defaultConnectors({ devMode: true }),
});

await fuel.selectConnector('Fuel Wallet');
await fuel.connect();
```

### Configuration Options

The `defaultConnectors` function accepts various configuration options to customize wallet connectivity:

#### Development Mode
- `devMode`: Enables development-specific connectors.

#### WalletConnect Configuration
- `wcProjectId`: Required for WalletConnect integration. This should be obtained from the [WalletConnect Dashboard](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/). Without a valid project ID, WalletConnect connectivity won't function properly.

#### Ethereum Integration
- `ethWagmiConfig`: Configuration for Ethereum integration via wagmi.
- `ethSkipAutoReconnect`: When set to true, prevents session loss when refreshing the page in certain conditions.

#### Burner Wallet Configuration
- `burnerWalletConfig.storage`: Custom storage implementation for the burner wallet.
- `burnerWalletConfig.chainId`: Chain ID for the burner wallet to use.

#### Provider Configuration
- `fuelProvider`: Allows providing a custom Provider instance.
- `chainId`: Required. Specifies the target chain ID for all connectors as a numeric value (e.g., 0, 1, 2).

You can use the `CHAIN_IDS` constant from the `fuels` package for standard chain IDs:
```ts
import { CHAIN_IDS } from 'fuels';

// Standard chain IDs
const mainnetChainId = CHAIN_IDS.fuel.mainnet; // 0
const testnetChainId = CHAIN_IDS.fuel.testnet; // 1
const devnetChainId = CHAIN_IDS.fuel.devnet;   // 2
```

#### Solana Integration
- `solanaConfig`: Configuration object for Solana wallet integrations.

#### Complete Example

```ts
import { Fuel, Provider, CHAIN_IDS } from 'fuels';
import { defaultConnectors } from '@fuels/connectors';
import { wagmiConfig } from './wagmi-config'; // Your wagmi configuration

// Chain and provider details
const CHAIN_ID = CHAIN_IDS.fuel.mainnet; // 0 for mainnet
const PROVIDER_URL = 'http://localhost:4000/v1/graphql';

const fuel = new Fuel({
  connectors: defaultConnectors({
    devMode: true,
    wcProjectId: 'YOUR_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID',
    ethWagmiConfig: wagmiConfig,
    ethSkipAutoReconnect: true,
    burnerWalletConfig: {
      storage: window.localStorage,
      chainId: CHAIN_ID,
    },
    chainId: CHAIN_ID,
    fuelProvider: new Provider(PROVIDER_URL),
    solanaConfig: {
      // Solana-specific configuration
    },
  }),
});

await fuel.selectConnector('Fuel Wallet');
await fuel.connect();
```

### Using a custom list
```ts
import { Fuel } from 'fuels';
import { FuelWalletConnector } from '@fuels/connectors';

const fuel = new Fuel({
  connectors: [new FuelWalletConnector()],
});

await fuel.selectConnector('Fuel Wallet');
await fuel.connect();
```

## Using React

We also provide a set of React hooks and a user interface (UI) for seamless interaction with connectors, eliminating the need for manual UI creation.

### Installation

```bash
npm install fuels @fuels/connectors @fuels/react @tanstack/react-query
```

- [fuels](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts) is the SDK that provides a set of utilities for interacting with the Fuel Network.
- [@fuels/connectors](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-connectors) is the collection of connectors that allow you to connect to the Fuel Wallet.
- [@fuels/react](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-connectors/tree/main/packages/react) is a set of React hooks and a UI for seamless interaction with connectors.
- [@tanstack/react-query](https://github.com/tanstack/query) is a library for managing and caching data in React applications.

### Example

#### Setup

Wrap your application with the providers `QueryClientProvider` and `FuelProvider`.

```tsx
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { Provider, CHAIN_IDS } from 'fuels';
import { FuelProvider } from '@fuels/react';
import { defaultConnectors } from '@fuels/connectors';

const queryClient = new QueryClient();
const PROVIDER_URL = 'http://localhost:4000/v1/graphql';
const CHAIN_ID = CHAIN_IDS.fuel.mainnet; // Using mainnet chain ID

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <FuelProvider fuelConfig={{ 
        connectors: defaultConnectors({ 
          devMode: true,
          wcProjectId: 'YOUR_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID',
          chainId: CHAIN_ID,
          fuelProvider: new Provider(PROVIDER_URL),
        }) 
      }}>
        <App />
      </FuelProvider>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

Alternatively, you can pass `ui={false}` to the `FuelProvider` to disable the UI in order to implement your own UI.

#### Usage

```ts
import { useConnectUI } from '@fuels/react';
const { connect, isConnecting } = useConnectUI();

<button onClick={connect}>
  {isConnecting ? 'Connecting...' : 'Connect'}
</button>
```
