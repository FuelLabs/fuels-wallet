# Getting Started

You can integrate your DApp seamlessly with Fuel Wallet using our simple API, which is injected directly into the browser window.
This eliminates the need for additional dependencies, allowing you to perform key actions effortlessly.
For even more powerful and customizable integration, use Fuel Wallet in conjunction with the [Fuel TS SDK](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuels-ts/).

<ConnectionAlert />

If you've correctly installed the Fuel wallet extension, the wallet SDK will be injected automatically on the `window` object on the property `fuel`. To access it, you can use `window.fuel`

```ts
window.fuel.connect();
```

You can try this code directly in the developer console.

## TypeScript

The Fuel Wallet SDK provides a package on npm, making it more convenient to use in TypeScript projects.
To use it, you must also install the [`fuels`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fuels) package as a dependency.

### Installation

```bash
npm install fuels @fuel-wallet/sdk
```

### Usage

To use the SDK in your TypeScript project, add the following line to your tsconfig.json file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["@fuel-wallet/sdk"]
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can use a [TypeScript reference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/triple-slash-directives.html) directive in any TypeScript file:

```ts
/// <reference types="@fuel-wallet/sdk" />
```

### Example

With the SDK imported, `fuel` will be conveniently typed and accessible on the `window` object.

```ts
window.fuel?.connect();
```

## Detect when fuel is loaded

It's possible that your application loads before `window.fuel` is injected. To detect when the `fuel` is loaded and ready to use, you can listen to the event `FuelLoaded` on the document.

<CodeImport file="../../examples/FuelLoaded.tsx" lineStart="10" lineEnd="21" />

<Examples.FuelLoaded />

### With React

In a React app, you can use the `useFuel` hook below to detect when `window.fuel` is loaded.

<CodeImport file="../../src/hooks/useFuel.tsx" />

Here is how you can use the `useFuel` hook in a component:

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/events/Accounts.tsx"
  lineStart="11"
  lineEnd="11"
/>
