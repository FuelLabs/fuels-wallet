# Getting Started

Integrate your DApp seamlessly with Fuel Wallet using our simple API, which is injected directly into the browser window.
This eliminates the need for additional dependencies, allowing you to perform key actions effortlessly.
For even more powerful and customizable integration, use Fuel Wallet in conjunction with the Fuel TS SDK.

<ConnectionAlert />

If you've correctly installed the Fuel wallet extension, the wallet SDK will be injected automatically on the `window` object on the property `fuel`. To access it, you can use `window.fuel`

```ts
window.fuel.connect();
```

You can try this code directly in the developer console.

## Typescript

The Fuel Wallet SDK provides a package on npm, making it more convenient to use in TypeScript projects.
To use it, you must also install the [`fuels`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fuels) package as a dependency.

### Installation

```bash
npm install fuels @fuel-wallet/sdk
```

### Usage

To use the SDK in your TypeScript project, add the following line to your tsconfig.json file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["@fuel-wallet/sdk"]
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can use a [TypeScript reference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/triple-slash-directives.html) directive in any TypeScript file:

```ts
/// <reference types="@fuel-wallet/sdk" />
```

### Example

With the SDK imported, `fuel` will be conveniently typed and accessible on the `window` object.

```ts
window.fuel?.connect();
```

## Detect when fuel is loaded

It's possible that your application loads before `window.fuel` is injected. To detect when the `fuel` is loaded and ready to use, you can listen to the event `FuelLoaded` on the document.
If you are using react take a look on the source code of the example bellow to see how we implement it.

<CodeImport file="../../examples/FuelLoaded.tsx" lineStart="10" lineEnd="21" />

<Examples.FuelLoaded />

## Request connection

First, you need to request a connection with the wallet, which will authorize your application to execute other actions. You can do this by accessing `fuel.connect()`.

<CodeImport file="../../examples/Connect.tsx" />

The `connect()` method returns a promise. If you prefer to do it in an async way, you can use `fuel.on('connection', () => void)` to
listen for changes in the connection.

<Examples.Connect />

## List user accounts

Once the connection is authorized, you can list the user accounts using `window.fuel.accounts()`.

<CodeImport file="../../examples/ListAccounts.tsx" />

<Examples.ListAccounts />

## Get current account

You can also get the current account being used in the wallet using `window.fuel.currentAccount()`.

<CodeImport file="../../examples/CurrentAccount.tsx" />

<Examples.CurrentAccount />

## Signing a message

With access to the user address and the connection authorized, you can request the user's signature using `fuel.signMessage`.

<CodeImport file="../../examples/SignMessage.tsx" />

<Examples.SignMessage />

## Transfering assets

To transfer an amount to other address, use the `wallet.transfer` method and pass in the address you want to send to and the amount to send.

<CodeImport file="../../examples/Transfer.tsx" />

<Examples.Transfer />

## List Assets in the Wallet

You can list the assets in the wallet using `window.fuel.assets()`.

<CodeImport file="../../examples/ListAssets.tsx" />

<Examples.ListAssets />

## Adding custom Assets

To add custom Assets, use the `wallet.addAssets` method and pass in the `Asset[]` you want to add.

<CodeImport file="../../examples/AddAssets.tsx" />

<Examples.AddAssets />

## Listening to events

To listen to events, you can use the `fuel.on` method. <br />
The first parameter is the event name and the second is the callback function. <br/ >
The events enum `FuelWalletEvents` can be imported from the `@fuel-wallet/sdk` package.

### Connection

To listen to connection events, you can use the `fuel.events.connection` event.

<CodeImport
  file="../../src/hooks/useIsConnected.tsx"
  lineStart="9"
  lineEnd="23"
/>

<Examples.Events.Connection />

### Accounts

To listen to accounts events, you can use the `fuel.events.accounts` event.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/events/Accounts.tsx"
  lineStart="23"
  lineEnd="33"
/>
<Examples.Events.Accounts />

### Current Account

To listen to current account events, you can use the `fuel.events.currentAccount` event.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/events/CurrentAccount.tsx"
  lineStart="23"
  lineEnd="35"
/>
<Examples.Events.CurrentAccount />

### Network Change

To listen to network events, you can use the `fuel.events.network` event.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/events/Network.tsx"
  lineStart="27"
  lineEnd="38"
/>

Switch the network in your wallet to see the event triggered.

<Examples.Events.Network />

### Assets

To listen to assets events, you can use the `fuel.events.assets` event.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/events/Assets.tsx"
  lineStart="24"
  lineEnd="34"
/>
<Examples.Events.Assets />
