# Getting Started

The Fuel Wallet SDK serves as a connection manager between your DApp and other wallets compatible with the Fuel Network. This package ensures that you can connect to the Fuel Wallet as well as any other wallet using a unified API.

If you are using **React** jump to the [React section](./#using-react).

## Installation

To begin integrating the Fuel Wallet SDK into your DApp, you first need to install the packages `@fuels/connectors` and `fuels`.

```bash
npm install fuels @fuels/connectors
```

The installation also requires the `fuels` SDK, as it is used to communicate with the Fuel Network and provides a set of utilities required for interacting with contracts on the Fuel Network.

## Example

You can import `defaultConnectors` from `@fuels/connectors` to get a list of all the default connectors. Besides that, you can also create your own connectors or import them individually.

### Using default connectors
```ts
import { Fuel } from 'fuels';
import { defaultConnectors } from '@fuels/connectors';

const fuel = new Fuel({
  connectors: defaultConnectors({ devMode: true }),
});

await fuel.selectConnector('Fuel Wallet');
await fuel.connect();
```

### Using a custom list
```ts
import { Fuel } from 'fuels';
import { FuelWalletConnector } from '@fuels/connectors';

const fuel = new Fuel({
  connectors: [new FuelWalletConnector()],
});

await fuel.selectConnector('Fuel Wallet');
await fuel.connect();
```

## Using React

We also provide a set of React hooks and a user interface (UI) for seamless interaction with connectors, eliminating the need for manual UI creation.

### Installation

```bash
npm install fuels @fuels/connectors @fuels/react @tanstack/react-query
```

- [fuels](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts) is the SDK that provides a set of utilities for interacting with the Fuel Network.
- [@fuels/connectors](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-connectors) is the collection of connectors that allow you to connect to the Fuel Wallet.
- [@fuels/react](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-connectors/tree/main/packages/react) is a set of React hooks and a UI for seamless interaction with connectors.
- [@tanstack/react-query](https://github.com/tanstack/query) is a library for managing and caching data in React applications.

### Example

#### Setup

Wrap your application with the providers `QueryClientProvider` and `FuelProvider`.

```tsx
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';

import { FuelProvider } from '@fuels/react';
import { defaultConnectors } from '@fuels/connectors';

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <FuelProvider fuelConfig={{ connectors: defaultConnectors({ devMode: true }) }}>
        <App />
      </FuelProvider>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

Alternatively, you can pass `ui={false}` to the `FuelProvider` to disable the UI in order to implement your own UI.

#### Usage

```ts
import { useConnectUI } from '@fuels/react';
const { connect, isConnecting } = useConnectUI();

<button onClick={connect}>
  {isConnecting ? 'Connecting...' : 'Connect'}
</button>
```
