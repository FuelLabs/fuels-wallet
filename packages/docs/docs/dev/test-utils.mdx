# Playwright Utils

The `@fuels/playwright-utils` package allows developers building frontend applications on fuel to test their application as it interacts with the fuel wallet. This package is compatible with the [playwright](https://playwright.dev/) test framework.

## Fixtures

If you are not using any custom test fixtures in your playwright tests import the fixtures directly from this package, and pass in the path to the fuel extension. You can download the extension manually or use our `downloadFuel` function.

```tsx
// e2e.test.ts
import { test } from '@fuel-wallet/playwright-utils';

test.use({ pathToExtension: './path/to/extension' });
// OR
const fuelPathToExtension = downloadFuel(FUEL_WALLET_VERSION');
test.use({ pathToExtension: fuelPathToExtension });
```

If you are using custom test fixtures in your playwright tests then setup the `context` and `extensionId` fixtures as shown in the [playwright docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/chrome-extensions#testing).

## `FuelWalletTestHelper`

The `FuelWalletTestHelper` is a class which allows you to interact with the fuel wallet extension.

static async walletSetup(
    context: BrowserContext,
    fuelExtensionId: string,
    fuelProviderUrl: string,
    chainName: string,
    mnemonic: string = FUEL_MNEMONIC,
    password: string = FUEL_WALLET_PASSWORD
): Promise<FuelWalletTestHelper>
```

This function sets up your fuel wallet extension and returns an instance of `FuelWalletTestHelper`.

### `walletConnect`

```tsx
async walletConnect(
    accountNames?: string[],
    connectCurrentAccount: boolean = true

### `addAssetFromHomeBalance`
