# React Hooks

This section covers the following topics:

1. [Installation](#installation)
2. [Getting Started](#getting-started)
3. [Reference](#reference)

## Installation

Before moving forward, make sure to install the `Fuel Wallet` browser extension. Check out the [install section](/docs/install/).

Once you have the extension installed, you can install the `@fuel-wallet/react` package.

### Adding the npm package

Go to your project directory and run the following command:

```bash
npm install fuels @fuel-wallet/react
```

This will install the react hooks package for `Fuel Wallet`.

### Setting up the types

Now add the following config parameters to your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["@fuel-wallet/react"]
  }
}
```

This allows the TypeScript compiler to recognize the types of the `Fuel Wallet` package.

## Getting Started

### Adding the provider

The first step is to wrap your application with the `FuelProvider` component. This component provides the context for the `Fuel Wallet` hooks to work.

```tsx
// index.tsx
import { FuelProvider } from '@fuel-wallet/react';
//...
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <FuelProvider>
      <App />
    </FuelProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

Now you are ready to start using the Fuel Wallet Hooks.

### Checking Connection

Now is time to move into the App.tsx file.

you can use the `useIsConnected` hook to check if the user is connected to the `Fuel Wallet` browser extension.

```tsx
const { isConnected } = useIsConnected();
```

This will return a boolean value indicating whether the user is connected.

```tsx
<button disabled={isConnected}>
  {isConnected ? 'connected' : 'not connected'}
</button>
```

### Connecting to the wallet

The next step is to connect to the wallet. This can be done by using the `useConnect` hook that returns the 'connect' function, you can use it to create a method to handle the wallet connection and add it to the button.

```tsx
const { connect } = useConnect();
const handleClick = async () => {
  connect();
};
```

```tsx
<button disabled={isConnected} onClick={handleClick}>
  {isConnected ? 'connected' : 'not connected'}
</button>
```

### Sending a transaction to a contract

Now that you have the wallet connected, we can send a transaction to a contract. For this example, we will use the counter contract from the [Fuel Quickstart](https://docs.fuel.network/guides/quickstart/building-a-smart-contract/).

This process requires the following process:

```tsx
// Gettting the current account address

const { accountAddress } = useAccount(); // expected return to be something like this fuel1r20zhdswcx78l7yw8nj5hhzwg05lmup7424kr9pyj0qeacftm6xqg827qc

// Use that address to get the wallet instantce

const { wallet } = useWallet(accountAddress); // wallet instance

// Use the wallet instance to invoke the contract method

async function increment() {
  const contract = CounterContractAbi__factory.connect(CONTRACT_ID, wallet);
  await contract.functions.increment().txParams({ gasPrice: 1 }).call();
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ Note: Don't forget to check out the [Fuel Quickstart](https://docs.fuel.network/guides/quickstart) to learn how to deploy and interact with a contract.

## Reference

### useAccount

[See source file](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-wallet/blob/master/packages/react/src/hooks/useAccount.tsx)

```tsx
const { account: string | undefined } = useAccount();
console.log(account)
// fuel1r20zhd...
```

Retrieves the current fuel account asynchronously and handles potential errors. The function returns the account data and relevant query properties for further use in the application.

### useBalance

[See source file](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-wallet/blob/master/packages/react/src/hooks/useBalance.tsx)

```tsx
const { balance: number | undefined } = useBalance({
  address: 'fuel1r20zhd...',
  assetId: '0x000000000...'
});

console.log(balance);
// 1000 (example balance)
```

Fetches the balance of a specified address and asset ID using the useProvider hook for accessing the provider. It asynchronously retrieves the balance and handles potential errors. Additionally, it includes a listener that triggers a balance refresh when the window gains focus. The function returns the balance data and relevant query properties for further use in the application.

### useChain

[See source file](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-wallet/blob/master/packages/react/src/hooks/useChain.tsx)

```tsx
const { chain: ChainInfo | undefined } = useChain();
console.log(chain.name)
// beta-4
```

Fetches information about the current blockchain network asynchronously using the useProvider hook. It handles potential errors during the fetch process and returns the chain data for the application's use.

### useConnect

[See source file](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-wallet/blob/master/packages/react/src/hooks/useConnect.tsx)

```tsx
const { connect: UseMutateAsyncFunction<boolean | undefined> } = useConnect();

const handleConnect = async () => {
  await connect('exampleConnectorName');
}

handleConnect();
```

Facilitates the connection to the Fuel wallet. It asynchronously handles the connection process, including potential errors, and allows selecting a connector by name. It also provides a function to initiate the connection and relevant mutation properties for managing the connection state.

### useConnectors
