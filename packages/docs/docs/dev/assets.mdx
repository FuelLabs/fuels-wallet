# Assets

## Transferring assets

To transfer a specific amount to another address, use the `wallet.transfer()` method.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/assets/TransferAssets.tsx"
  commentBlock="transferAsset"
/>
<Examples.TransferAssets />

## List Assets in the Wallet

You can list the assets added in the wallet by using the `assets()` method.

<CodeImport file="../../examples/assets/ListAssets.tsx" commentBlock="assets" />
<Examples.ListAssets />

## Adding custom Assets

To add custom assets, use the `useAssets()` method to add a single asset, or the `addAssets()` method to add multiple assets.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/assets/AddAssets.tsx"
  commentBlock="addAssets"
/>
<Examples.AddAssets />
