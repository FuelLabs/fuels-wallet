# Wallet Connectors

A wallet connector is an interface to integrate with third-party wallets on the Fuel Ecosystem. It exposes all currently installed wallets in a unified manner
via `window.fuel`.

<Examples.Connectors />

## Methods

### Listing connectors

To list all available connectors you can use the `listConnectors()` method.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/Connectors.tsx"
  commentBlock="listConnectors"
/>

### Selecting connector

To select a different wallet connector use the `selectConnector(connectorName: string)` method.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/Connectors.tsx"
  commentBlock="selectConnector"
/>

## Events

### `CurrentConnector`

This event is triggered when the current connector is updated. The callback function receives the `FuelWalletConnector` object.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/Connectors.tsx"
  commentBlock="eventCurrentConnector"
/>

### Connectors

This event is triggered when the connectors list is updated. The callback function receives the list of connectors, `Array<FuelWalletConnector>`.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/Connectors.tsx"
  commentBlock="eventConnectors"
/>

## For Wallet Developers

Third-party wallets developed by the community can use the wallet connector to integrate with the current `fuel` instance on the window, enabling a better experience for
developers and users.

### Creating a Wallet Connector

Inside `pageScript.ts` you can call the method `createConnector` instead of creating a new object on the window. This method will add your connector to the current,
`window.fuel` element.

```ts
import { createConnector } from '@fuel-wallet/sdk';

createConnector({ name: 'Wallet Name' });
```

If you are using our Communication SDK [Content Page Script](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/content_scripts/) import `ContentProxyConnection` and pass the name of wallet extension.

> Otherwise, remember to filter events by the ones that have your wallet connector name as the target.

```ts
import { ContentProxyConnection } from '@fuel-wallet/sdk';

// Start the content page script with the current Wallet Name
ContentProxyConnection.start('Wallet Name');

// ...pageScript.ts logic for page script injection
```
