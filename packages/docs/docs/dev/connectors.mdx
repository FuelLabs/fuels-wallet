# Fuel Wallet Connectors

Fuel Wallet Connectors are a interface provided by Wallet developers to allow, you DApp to integrate with specific Wallets.

You can learn more about how Fuel Wallet Connectors work, by reading the [Fuel Wallet Connectors](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-wallet/wiki/Fuel-Wallet-Connectors) spec.

## Setup Fuel Wallet Connectors

The Fuel Wallet SDK allows you to provide a set of connectors, when creating a new instance.
By default if you don't provide any connectors, the SDK will use the default connectors, `FuelWalletConnector` and `FueletWalletConnector`.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connectors/ListConnectors.tsx"
  commentBlock="createInstance"
/>

## Listing Connectors

When working with mutiple connectors you should allow users to select the Connectors he want to use for interacting with your DApp.
Once the `connectors()` method is called the Fuel Wallet SDK, will query informations from the connectors to allow you to know,
waht connectors are installed.

We also recommend to use the `connectors` listener on places that will use the `connectors` method as the availability can change.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connectors/ListConnectors.tsx"
  commentBlock="listConnectors"
/>
<Examples.ListConnectors />

## Selecting Connector

Once you have a list of connectors, you can allow the user to select the connector he want to use. By using the methoid `selectConnect`.
If the connector is not installed, the SDK will return false.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connectors/SelectConnector.tsx"
  commentBlock="selectConnector"
/>

### Interacting with the selected connector

Once you have selected a connector, you can interact with it using all the available methods.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connectors/SelectConnector.tsx"
  commentBlock="connect"
/>

<Examples.SelectConnector />

## With React

### Connectors UI

When using the react application you can use the Connectors UI provided by react package.

<Examples.ConnectorUIHook />

You can see the full a DApp example on the [examples](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-wallet/tree/master/examples) folder.

### Only hooks

If you prefer to build your own UI for the connectors you can achive the experience using
the hooks `useConnect` and `useConnectors`.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connectors/hooks/SelectConnectorHook.tsx"
  commentBlock="useConnectors"
/>

<Examples.SelectConnectorHook />
