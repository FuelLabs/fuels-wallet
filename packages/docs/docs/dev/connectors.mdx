# Fuel Wallet Connectors

Fuel Wallet Connectors are an interface provided by wallet developers to allow your DApp to integrate with specific wallets.

You can learn more about how Fuel Wallet Connectors work, by reading the [Fuel Wallet Connectors](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-wallet/wiki/Fuel-Wallet-Connectors) spec.

## Setup Fuel Wallet Connectors

The Fuel Wallet SDK enables you to include a set of connectors when creating a new instance. If you don't provide any connectors, the SDK will default to using the `FuelWalletConnector()` and `FueletWalletConnector()` methods.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connectors/ListConnectors.tsx"
  commentBlock="createInstance"
/>

## Listing Connectors

When working with multiple connectors, you should enable users to select the connectors they wish to use for interacting with your DApp. Once the `connectors()` method is called, the Fuel Wallet SDK will query information from the connectors, allowing you to determine which connectors are installed.

We also recommend to use the `connectors` listener on places that will use the `connectors()` method as the availability can change.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connectors/ListConnectors.tsx"
  commentBlock="listConnectors"
/>
<Examples.ListConnectors />

## Selecting Connector

Once you have a list of connectors, you can enable the user to select the connector they wish to use by using the `selectConnect()` method. If the connector is not installed, the SDK will return false.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connectors/SelectConnector.tsx"
  commentBlock="selectConnector"
/>

### Interacting with the selected connector

Once you have selected a connector, you can interact with it using all the available methods.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connectors/SelectConnector.tsx"
  commentBlock="connect"
/>

<Examples.SelectConnector />

## With React

### Connectors UI

When using a React application, you can utilize the Connectors UI provided by the React package.

<Examples.ConnectorUIHook />

You can see the full a DApp example on the [examples](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-wallet/tree/master/examples) folder.

### Only hooks

If you prefer to build your own UI for the connectors you achieve the experience using
the hooks `useConnect()` and `useConnectors()`.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connectors/hooks/SelectConnectorHook.tsx"
  commentBlock="useConnectors"
/>

<Examples.SelectConnectorHook />
