# Connecting

## Requesting a Connection

Before interacting with the wallet, you need to request a connection, which will authorize your application to execute other actions. You can do this by calling the `connect()` method on the `window.fuel` object.

<CodeImport file="../../examples/Connect.tsx" commentBlock="connect" />

To disconnect, use the `disconnect()` method.

<CodeImport file="../../examples/Connect.tsx" commentBlock="disconnect" />

<Examples.Connect />

## Checking for a Connection

To check if the user's wallet is already connected, you can use the `isConnected()` method.

{/* <CodeImport file="../../../sdk/src/tests/Fuel.test.ts" testCase="isConnected" /> */}

<Examples.IsConnected />

## Listening to Connection Events

The `connect()` method returns a promise. If you prefer to do it in an async way, you can use `fuel.on('connection', () => void)` to
listen for changes in the connection.

<CodeImport
  file="../../src/hooks/useIsConnected.tsx"
  commentBlock="eventConnection"
/>

<Examples.Events.Connection />

## With React

In a React app, you can use the `useIsConnected` hook below to check if the user's wallet is connected.

```ts
import { useIsConnected } from '@fuel-wallet/react';
// ...
const { isConnected } = useIsConnected();
```

You can import the `useConnect` hook to access the `connect` function and request a connection.

```tsx
import { useConnect } from '@fuel-wallet/react';
// ...
const { connect } = useConnect();
await connect();
```

To disconnect, use the `useDisconnect()` hook.

```tsx
import { useDisconnect } from '@fuel-wallet/react';
// ...
const { disconnect } = useDisconnect();
await disconnect();
```
