# Connecting

## Checking if a Connector is available

Before performing other actions, the Application should check whether the user has a Wallet installed. While this is not required, it is good practice to ensure a better user experience.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connecting/CheckWallet.tsx"
  commentBlock="checkWallet"
/>

As a user installs a wallet, you can listen for changes on the status of the `currentConnector`.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connecting/CheckWallet.tsx"
  commentBlock="watchWallet"
/>

<Examples.CheckWallet />

You can learn more about connectors and how they work to allow multiple wallet's [here](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-wallet/wiki/Fuel-Wallet-Connectors)

## Requesting a Connection

Before any user actions begin, the user must authorize the connection by calling the `connect()` method. This will initiate the connection flow in the user's Wallet, particularly if the user has more accounts than what is currently available to the connection.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connecting/Connect.tsx"
  commentBlock="connect"
/>

<Examples.Connect />

## Checking connection state

To check if the user's wallet is already connected, you can use the `isConnected()` method.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connecting/CheckConnection.tsx"
  commentBlock="checkConnection"
/>

<Examples.CheckConnection />

## Watching connection state

Since a user can add or remove a connection directly inside the wallet, we also recommend that your application listens for connection state changes using the event listener.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connecting/CheckConnection.tsx"
  commentBlock="watchConnection"
/>

## Removing connection

In some cases, an application may want to provide an experience for the user to remove the connection. In these cases, you can use the `disconnect()` method.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connecting/Disconnect.tsx"
  commentBlock="disconnect"
/>

<Examples.Disconnect />

## Using React Hooks

### Requesting a Connection

In React applications, you can leverage our ready to use hooks, which include event tracking.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connecting/hooks/ConnectHook.tsx"
  commentBlock="connect"
/>

<Examples.ConnectHook />

### Removing connection

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connecting/hooks/DisconnectHook.tsx"
  commentBlock="disconnect"
/>

<Examples.DisconnectHook />

### Checking connection state

All hooks implement validations to ensure that the state is synchronized, using the methods and events available from the SDK.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connecting/hooks/ConnectHook.tsx"
  commentBlock="checkConnection"
