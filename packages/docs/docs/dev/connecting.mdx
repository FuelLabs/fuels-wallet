# Connecting

## Requesting a Connection

Before interacting with the wallet, you need to request a connection, which will authorize your application to execute other actions. You can do this by calling the `connect()` method on the `window.fuel` object.

<CodeImport file="../../examples/Connect.tsx" commentBlock="connect" />

To disconnect, use the `disconnect()` method.

<CodeImport file="../../examples/Connect.tsx" commentBlock="disconnect" />

<Examples.Connect />

## Checking for a Connection

To check if the user's wallet is already connected, you can use the `isConnected()` method.

<CodeImport file="../../../sdk/src/tests/Fuel.test.ts" testCase="isConnected" />

<Examples.IsConnected />

## Listening to Connection Events

The `connect()` method returns a promise. If you prefer to do it in an async way, you can use `fuel.on('connection', () => void)` to
listen for changes in the connection.

<CodeImport
  file="../../src/hooks/useIsConnected.tsx"
  commentBlock="eventConnection"
/>

<Examples.Events.Connection />

### With React

In a React app, you can use the `useIsConnected` hook below to check if the user's wallet is connected.
This hook depends on the `useFuel` hook on the [Getting Started](./getting-started.mdx) page.

<CodeImport file="../../src/hooks/useIsConnected.tsx" />

Here is how you can use the `useIsConnected` hook in a component:

<CodeImport file="../../examples/events/Accounts.tsx" commentBlock="useFuel" />
