# Signing a Message

With access to the user address and the connection authorized, you can request the user's signature using `signMessage()`.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/signMessage/SignMessage.tsx"
  commentBlock="signMessage"
/>
<Examples.SignMessage />

## With React

In a React app, once the connection is established, you can use the `useWallet()` hook to get a wallet instance and sign the transaction.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/signMessage/hooks/SignMessageHook.tsx"
  commentBlock="signMessage"
/>
<Examples.SignMessageHook />
