# Networks

## Get the Current Network

To detect the current network the user's wallet is connected to, use the `network()` method on the `window.fuel` object.

<CodeImport file="../../examples/Network.tsx" />

<Examples.Network />

## Listening for Network Changes

To listen to network events, you can use the `fuel.events.network` event.

<CodeImport file="../../examples/events/Network.tsx" />

Switch the network in your wallet to see the event triggered.

<Examples.Events.Network />
