# Networks

## Get the Current Network

To detect the current network the user's wallet is connected to, use the `network()` method on the `window.fuel` object.

<CodeImport file="../../examples/Network.tsx" />

<Examples.Network />

## Adding custom Network

To add custom Network, use the `wallet.addNetwork` method and pass in the `Network` you want to add.

<CodeImport file="../../examples/AddNetwork.tsx" commentBlock="addNetwork" />

<Examples.AddNetwork />

## Listening for Network Changes

To listen to network events, you can use the `fuel.events.network` event.

<CodeImport file="../../examples/events/Network.tsx" commentBlock="network" />

Switch the network in your wallet to see the event triggered.

<Examples.Events.Network />

## With React

In a react app you can use the `useChain` hook as shown below to get information about the current chain.

```tsx
import { useChain } from '@fuel-wallet/react';
// ...
const { chain } = useChain();
console.log(chain.name);
// beta-4
```
