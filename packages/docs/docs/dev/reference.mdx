# API Reference

## Add ABI

`addAbi(abiMap: AbiMap): Promise<boolean>`<br />
Add the ABI to the user's wallet.

## Add Asset

`addAsset(asset: Asset): Promise<boolean>`<br />
Request the user to add metadata for an asset to the wallet.

## Add Assets

`addAssets(asset: Asset[]): Promise<boolean>`<br />
Request the user to add metadata for multiple assets to the wallet at once.

## Add Network

`addNetwork(url: string): Promise<boolean>`<br />
Request the user to add a new network. Return true if success or false it fails.

## Clean

`clean(): void`<br />
Clean the storage used by the Fuel SDK, which is utilized to keep track of the selected connector.

## Connect

`connect(): Promise<boolean>`<br />
Request permission to start a connection between the project and the wallet. Return the connection state.

## Current Account

`currentAccount(): Promise<string | null>`<br />
Return the current account being used in the wallet application.
If the account selected is not authorized for the connection, returns null.

## Current Connector

`currentConnector(): FuelConnector`<br />
Return the current selected connector.

## Current Network

`currentNetwork(): Promise<Network>`<br />
Return the current network being used in the wallet application.

## Destory

`destroy(): void`<br />
Removes all listeners and cleans the storage.

## Disconnect

`disconnect(): Promise<boolean>`<br />
Disconnect your project from the wallet. Return the connection state.

## Events

Fuel emits events when certain actions occur. These events can be listened to by using the `on` method.

The events API follows the native Node.js `EventEmitter` enabling, `on`, `once`, and `off`.
The events enum `FuelWalletEvents` can be imported from the `@fuel-wallet/sdk` package.

### Usage

The `fuel` object has an `events` property which is an enum of all the events that can be listened to. <br />
The `on` method takes two arguments, the event name and a callback function. The callback function receives data associated with the event.

```ts
fuel.on(fuel.events.connection, (connectionState) => {
  console.log(connectionState);
});
```

### Event Types

| Event              | Trigger                   | Params                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `connectors`       | connectors change         | `Array<FuelConnector>` |
| `currentConnector` | currentConnector change   | `FuelConnector`        |
| `accounts`         | accounts available change | `Array<string>`        |
| `currentAccount`   | current account change    | `string \| null`       |
| `connection`       | connection state change   | `boolean`              |
| `currentNetwork`   | cuurent network change    | `Network`              |
| `assets`           | assets metadata change    | `Array<Asset>`         |

## Get ABI

`getABI(contractId: string): Promise<JsonAbi>`<br />
Return the ABI of the given contractId, or null if not found.

## Get Connection Status

`isConnected(): Promise<boolean>`<br />
Return the state of the application connection.

## Get Connector

`getConnector(connectorName: string): FuelConnector`<br />
Return the connector with the given name.

## Get Wallet

`getWallet(address: string | AbstractAddress, provider?: FuelWalletProvider): Promise<FuelWalletLocked>`<br />
Return a `FuelWalletLocked` instance, which can be used for contracts, transfers, and other interactions.

## Has ABI

`hasABI(contractId: string): Promise<boolean>`<br />
Return a boolean indicating if the ABI for the given contractId is found.

## Has Connector

`hasConnector(connectorName?: string | FuelConnector): Promise<boolean>`<br />
Check if any connector is available or, if a connector is provided, check whether it is available.

## List Accounts

`accounts(): Promise<Array<string>>`<br />
Return the accounts authorized for the current connection.

## List Assets

`assets(): Promise<Array<Asset>>`<br />
Return the list of assets in the current wallet.

## List Connectors

Request a message signature for one specific account

## Select Connector

`selectConnector(connectorName: string): Promise<boolean>` <br />
This method will check if the desired connector is installed. If it is not detected in 1 second, the method throws an error.

## Select Network

`selectNetwork(url: string): Promise<boolean>`<br />
Request the user to switch to a different network. Return true if success or false it fails.
