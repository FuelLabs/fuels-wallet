# Install

Before start using our SDK, you need first to install Fuel wallet browser extension. Since we're already in a alpha version, isn't possible to download directly from Chrome Extensions Store, so you need to download [FuelWallet zip file](https://fuels-wallet.vercel.app/preview/fuel-wallet.zip) and import directly on your extensions management page, on chrome or brave.
You can also watch the video bellow to have some instructions on how to install.
