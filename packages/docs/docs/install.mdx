# Install

Before start using our SDK, you need first to install Fuel wallet browser extension. Since we're already in a alpha version, isn't possible to download directly from Chrome Extensions Store, so you need to download [FuelWallet zip file](https://fuels-wallet.vercel.app/preview/fuel-wallet.zip) and import directly on your extensions management page, on chrome or brave.

## Installing Extension

- Inside Chrome or Brave.
- Open the extensions page; it can be done by:
  - Clicking on settings -> extensions or;
  - Accessing `brave://extensions/` or `chrome://extensions/`.
- Enable the "Developer mode" switch on the top left
- Load `fuel-wallet.zip` by:
  - Dragging your downloaded Fuel wallet file and dropping it in the extensions page or;
  - Clicking on `Load unpacked` and select the file.
- If all goes right, an onboarding page will instantly open.

Fuel Wallet extension is now ready for your best use.

## Wallet SDK

After install our browser extension, the wallet SDK will be injected automatically on the `window` object on property `FuelWeb3`. To access it, you can use `window.FuelWeb3`

You can see the SDK working in the next page.
