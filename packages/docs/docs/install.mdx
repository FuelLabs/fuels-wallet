## Wallet SDK

After installing our browser extension, the wallet SDK will be injected automatically on the `window` object on the property `fuel`. To access it, you can use `window.fuel`.

You can see the SDK working on the [Getting Started](../dev/getting-started) page.

## Install from source code

You can also install the next version of Fuel Wallet directly from source code. To do this:

- Download <DownloadWalletZip />;
- Inside Chrome or Brave;
- Open the extensions page; it can be done by:
  - Clicking on settings -> extensions or;
  - Accessing `brave://extensions/` or `chrome://extensions/`.
- Enable the "Developer mode" switch on the top right
- Load `fuel-wallet.zip` by:
  - Dragging your downloaded Fuel wallet file and dropping it in the extensions page or;
  - Clicking on `Load unpacked` and selecting the file.
- If all goes right, an onboarding page will instantly open.

The Fuel Wallet extension is now ready to use.
