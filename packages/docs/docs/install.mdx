# Install

Before using our SDK, you first need to install the Fuel wallet browser extension.
To install, download the [FuelWallet zip file](https://wallet.fuel.network/app/fuel-wallet.zip) and import directly on your extensions management page on Chrome or Brave.
You can also watch the video below to see how to install.
Since the wallet is still in an alpha version, it isn't possible to download directly from the Chrome Web Store.

## Installing Extension

- Inside Chrome or Brave.
- Open the extensions page; it can be done by:
  - Clicking on settings -> extensions or;
  - Accessing `brave://extensions/` or `chrome://extensions/`.
- Enable the "Developer mode" switch on the top left
- Load `fuel-wallet.zip` by:
  - Dragging your downloaded Fuel wallet file and dropping it in the extensions page or;
  - Clicking on `Load unpacked` and select the file.
- If all goes right, an onboarding page will instantly open.

The Fuel Wallet extension is now ready to use.

## Wallet SDK

After installing our browser extension, the wallet SDK will be injected automatically on the `window` object on the property `fuel`. To access it, you can use `window.fuel`.

You can see the SDK working in the [Getting Started](../dev/getting-started) page.
