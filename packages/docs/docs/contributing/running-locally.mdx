# Running locally

This is a guide that will show you how you can run this project locally if you want to test or make contributions to our Fuel Wallet SDK.

## Running the project

### Requirements

This project includes frontend. To begin, install dependencies:

- [Node.js 20.11.0 or latest stable](https://nodejs.org/en/). We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install.
- [pnpm v9.5.0 or latest stable](https://pnpm.io/installation/)
- [Docker v0.8.2 or latest stable](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose v2.6.0 or latest stable](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Getting the Repository

1. Visit the [Fuel Wallet](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-wallet) repo and fork the project.
2. Then clone your forked copy to your local machine and get to work.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-wallet
cd fuels-wallet
```

### Install Dependencies

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Setup Environment Variables

```sh
cp packages/app/.env.example packages/app/.env
```

### Run Local Node

In this step, we are going to;

- launch a local `fuel-core` node;
- launch a local `faucet` API;

Make sure you have docker installed and running, before running the command below

```sh
pnpm node:up
```

### Run Web App

Start a local development frontend. After running the below command you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the frontend.

```sh
pnpm dev
```

## Project Overview

This section has a brief description of each directory. More details can be found inside each package, by clicking on the links.

- [packages/app](@repository/packages/app/) Frontend Fuel Wallet application
- [packages/config](@repository/packages/config/) Build configurations

### Useful Scripts

To make life easier we added as many useful scripts as possible to our [`package.json`](@repository/package.json). These are some of the most used during development:

```sh
pnpm <command name>
```

| Script          | Description                                                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dev`           | Run development server for the web app [packages/app](@repository/packages/app/) |
| `dev:storybook` | Run storybook, which is the place we use to develop our components.              |
| `test`          | Run all units tests that are based on Jest.                                      |
| `test:e2e`      | Run all E2E tests that are based on Cypress.                                     |

> Other scripts can be found in [`package.json`](@repository/package.json).

### Running Tests

Please make sure you have done these steps first:

- [Getting the Repository](#getting-the-repository)
- [Install Dependencies](#install-dependencies)
- [Run Local Node](#run-local-node)

### Run Tests in Development Mode

All tests are run against the local node configured in the files `packages/app/.env` (or `packages/app/.env.example` if the file exists).

Before running test, make sure a local test node is running:

```sh
pnpm node:up
```

Then, to run tests use:

```sh
pnpm test
```

### Running E2E Tests

To run E2E tests, follow these steps:

#### Run Tests E2E in Development Mode

```sh
pnpm node:up
```

```sh
pnpm dev:crx
```

```sh
pnpm test:e2e
```

#### Run Tests E2E in CI/TEST env Mode

```sh
pnpm node:up
```

```sh
NODE_ENV=test pnpm build:app
```

```sh
NODE_ENV=test pnpm test:e2e
```
