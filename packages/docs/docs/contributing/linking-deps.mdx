# Supported dependencies

We support locally link with [`@fuel-ui`](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-ui) and [@fuel-ts](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts) repositories

# Using local dependencies in wallet project

This will link dependencies within wallet monorepo to your global `pnpm` store, enabling you to use `@fuel-ui` and/or `@fuel-ts` packages via links in your local projects.
This task may be tedious, but you can accomplish it by following these steps:

1. In the root directory of the repositories(`@fuel-ui` and/or `@fuel-ts`):

- Link dependency to global pnpm store:

```sh
pnpm -r exec pnpm link --global --dir ./
```

- Watch your changes and make sure they will reflect in wallet:

```sh
pnpm build:watch
```

2. Inside `fuels-wallet` root directory, edit `scripts/deps.sh`.

- If you're enabling link to `@fuel-ui`, enable this configuration:

```sh
LINK_FUEL_UI=true
```

- If you're enabling link to `@fuel-ts`, enable this configuration:

```sh
LINK_FUEL_TS=true
```

3. That's it. Now inside `fuels-wallet` root directory, run your dev command as you wish:

```sh
pnpm dev
pnpm dev:deps
pnpm dev:crx
```

> **Note**
>
> This command will:
>
> - Link dependency repos across all wallet monorepo packages, including the root
> - Run dev server with linked dependencies

Done! Now your changes in `@fuel-ui` and/or `@fuel-ts` will reflect in wallet project. Test with a simple `console.log` to make sure it worked.

### Troubleshooting

If you're linking for the first time, you might need:

```sh
  pnpm setup
```

If it still have problems, you might need to setup again (As `pnpm` releases new version, the global folder structure may change)

```sh
  pnpm setup
```
