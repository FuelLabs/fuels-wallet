# Supported dependencies

We support locally linking with [`@fuel-ui`](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-ui) and 
[`@fuel-ts`](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts) repositories.

# Using local dependencies in the wallet project

This will link dependencies within the wallet monorepo to your global `pnpm` store, enabling 
you to use `@fuel-ui` and/or `@fuel-ts` packages via links in your local projects. 
This task may require additional effort, but you can accomplish it by following these steps:

1. In the root directory of the repositories (`@fuel-ui` and/or `@fuel-ts`):

- Link the dependency to the global `pnpm` store:

```sh
pnpm -r exec pnpm link --global --dir ./
```

- Execute your build and ensure changes reflect in the wallet:

```sh
pnpm build:packages
```

2. Inside the `fuels-wallet` root directory, edit `scripts/deps.sh`.

- If you're enabling the link to `@fuel-ui`, set the following configuration:

```sh
LINK_FUEL_UI=true
```

- If you're enabling the link to `@fuel-ts`, set the following configuration:

```sh
LINK_FUEL_TS=true
```

3. Inside the `fuels-wallet` root directory, run your development command as needed:

```sh
pnpm dev
pnpm dev:deps
pnpm dev:crx
```

> **Note**
>
> These commands will:
>
> - Link the dependency repositories across all wallet monorepo packages, including the root.
> - Run the development server with linked dependencies.

Done! Now, changes in `@fuel-ui` and/or `@fuel-ts` will reflect in the wallet project. 
To verify, run a simple `console.log` test or follow the detailed verification steps below.

### Detailed Verification Steps

After linking dependencies, itâ€™s essential to verify that everything works as expected. 
Here are some recommended tests:

1. **Component Rendering Test**: Ensure components from `@fuel-ui` render correctly in the Fuel 
Wallet app. Use a test to check if components display as expected:

```javascript
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import { SomeComponent } from '@fuel-ui';

test('renders Fuel UI component correctly', () => {
  const { getByText } = render(<SomeComponent />);
  expect(getByText('Expected text')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

2. **Functionality Test**: Verify that functions from `@fuel-ts` perform as expected. For 
instance, if `@fuel-ts` includes utility functions, test their output to confirm proper 
integration with the main project.

```javascript
import { someFunction } from '@fuel-ts';

test('someFunction returns expected data', async () => {
  const result = await someFunction();
  expect(result).toEqual(expectedData);
});
```

3. **End-to-End (E2E) Test**: Run an E2E test to confirm that key user flows (like wallet 
connection) work as expected with the linked dependencies.

```javascript
describe('Fuel Wallet Integration', () => {
  it('should successfully connect to Fuel Wallet', () => {
    cy.visit('http://localhost:3000');
    cy.get('[data-testid="connect-button"]').click();
    cy.contains('Connected').should('be.visible');
  });
});
```

These tests will help ensure that your local dependencies are correctly linked and functional 
within the Fuel Wallet environment.

### Troubleshooting

If you're linking for the first time, you might need:

```sh
  pnpm setup
```

If issues persist, you might need to run the setup again (as `pnpm` releases new versions, 
the global folder structure may change).

```sh
  pnpm setup
```
