# Using local @fuel-ui packages

This will link all packages inside our monorepo in your global `pnpm` store, enabling you to use `@fuel-ui` packages via links in your local projects. This task may be tedious, but you can accomplish it by following these steps:

1. Run the following command inside the root directory of `@fuel-ui`:

```sh
pnpm -r exec pnpm link --global --dir ./
```

2. Next, open a new terminal tab within the root directory of the `@fuel-ui` package and build all packages in watch mode by running:

```sh
pnpm build:watch
```

3. Inside `fuels-wallet` repository, Run this command:

```sh
pnpm dev:link-deps
```

> **Note**
> This command:
>
> - Links all `@fuel-ui` packages across all monorepo packages, including the root
> - Run dev server with linked dependencies
>   - Command is different from the usual `pnpm dev` because it uses `@fuel-ui` packages in an alias configuration inside Vite. By default, PNPM doesn't change `publishConfig` when linking packages, and this can generate an error because Vite tries to get the `package.json:main` property on `@fuel-ui` packages, and locally they are pointing to the `.tsx` files
> - This command runs with default dependency names to link `fuel-ui`. If you want edit the dependencies you want to link:
>   - locate `deps` variable in `scrips/deps.sh`
>   - insert your desired local dependencies to link, splitting by white space

### Troubleshooting

If you're linking for the first time, you might need:

```sh
  pnpm setup
```

If it still have problems, you might need to setup again (As `pnpm` releases new version, the global folder structure may change)

```sh
  pnpm setup
```
