# Using local @fuel-ui packages

This will link all packages inside our monorepo in your global `pnpm` store, enabling you to use `@fuel-ui` packages via links in your local projects. This task may be tedious, but you can accomplish it by following these steps:

1. Run the following command inside the root directory of `@fuel-ui`:

```sh
pnpm -r exec pnpm link --global --dir ./
```

2. Next, open a new terminal tab within the root directory of the `@fuel-ui` package and build all packages in watch mode by running:

```sh
pnpm build:watch
```

3. Inside the `fuels-wallet` repository, run this command:

```sh
pnpm link:fuel-ui
```

> **Note**
> This command links all `@fuel-ui` packages across all monorepo packages, including the root

4. Now that you've globally linked using pnpm inside the `@fuel-ui` folder and also inside the `fuels-wallet` folder, you can go to the `./packages/app` directory in this repository and run the following command to run Vite using the linked packages:

```sh
pnpm dev:with-links
```

> **Note**
> This command is different from the usual `pnpm dev` because it uses `@fuel-ui` packages in an alias configuration inside Vite. By default, PNPM doesn't change `publishConfig` when linking packages, and this can generate an error because Vite tries to get the `package.json:main` property on `@fuel-ui` packages, and locally they are pointing to the `.tsx` files.

### Troubleshooting

If you're linking for the first time, you might need:

```sh
  pnpm setup
```

If it still have problems, you might need to setup again (As `pnpm` releases new version, the global folder structure may change)

```sh
  pnpm setup
```
