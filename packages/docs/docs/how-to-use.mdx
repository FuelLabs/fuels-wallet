## Importing Your Ledger Solana Account into a Hot Wallet

If you've previously connected to our platform using a Ledger-backed Solana account, you may be unable to sign off-chain messages due to a limitation in Ledger's support. This guide explains how to regain access by temporarily importing your Ledger Solana account into a hot wallet such as Phantom or Solflare.

⚠️ **Warning**: Only follow these steps if you understand the risks of exposing your recovery phrase to a hot (internet-connected) environment. Never enter your seed phrase into an untrusted app, extension, or website. Proceed only if necessary and be prepared to move your funds immediately after signing.

### What You'll Need

- Your 24-word recovery phrase from your Ledger device
- A computer or phone with internet access
- Phantom or Solflare wallet app or browser extension

### Steps to Import Your Ledger Account into a Hot Wallet

#### 1. Install a Solana Hot Wallet

Choose one of the following:
- Phantom Wallet
- Solflare Wallet

Install the browser extension or mobile app as needed.

#### 2. Start Wallet Setup and Choose "Import Wallet"

Open the wallet and look for an option like:
- "Use Secret Recovery Phrase"
- "I already have a wallet"

Select this to proceed with importing your existing wallet.

#### 3. Enter Your 24-Word Ledger Recovery Phrase

When prompted, carefully enter the 24 words from your Ledger device.

Ensure that:
- You are in a secure and private environment.
- You will not reuse this imported wallet for long-term storage.

#### 4. Derive the Correct Solana Account

Solana wallets use specific derivation paths.

For Phantom Wallet:
- Phantom supports multiple derivation paths, including those used by Ledger devices.
- However, Phantom will only display addresses from these paths if there is existing activity (such as a balance or transaction history) associated with them.
- If your Ledger-derived Solana account has prior activity, Phantom should automatically detect and display it upon importing the recovery phrase.
- If the account does not appear, you may need to manually add accounts or use a different wallet that allows manual derivation path selection.

For Solflare Wallet:
- Solflare allows manual selection of derivation paths during the import process.
- Use the derivation path: m/44'/501'/0'/0'
- If the wallet shows a different address from your Ledger account, check for manual derivation path options and adjust accordingly.

#### 5. Sign the Required Message in the Fuel App

Once your account is correctly imported and visible:
- Reconnect this hot wallet to the Fuel application.
- Proceed with the required signature operation to authorize or unlock the Fuel predicate account.

#### 6. Immediately Move Your Funds to a Secure Wallet

After signing:
- Send your assets to a new address secured by your Ledger or a trusted wallet.
- Do not leave funds in the imported hot wallet.

### Important Security Notice

- This method is not recommended for long-term use.
- Exposing your recovery phrase to a hot wallet introduces significant security risks.
- After completing the process, delete the hot wallet installation and reset browser extensions if necessary.
