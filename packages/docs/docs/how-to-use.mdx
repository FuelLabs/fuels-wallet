# How to use

<ConnectionAlert />

If you've correctly installed the Fuel wallet extension, the wallet SDK will be injected automatically on the `window` object on property `fuel`. To access it, you can use `window.fuel`

```ts
window.fuel.connect();
```

You can try this code directly on the developer console.

## Request connection

First of all, you need to connect and authorize your application; this will authorize your application to execute other actions. You can do this by accessing `fuel.connect()`.

<CodeImport file="../examples/Connect.tsx" lineStart={15} lineEnd={16} />

The `connect()` method returns a promise; if you prefer to do it in an async way, you can use `fuel.on('connection', () => void)` to
listen for changes in the connection.

<Examples.Connect />

## List user accounts

Once the connection is authorized, you can list the user accounts using `window.fuel.accounts()`.

<CodeImport file="../examples/ListAccounts.tsx" lineStart={18} lineEnd={19} />

<Examples.ListAccounts />

## Signing a message

Having access to the user address and the connection authorized, you can now request the user for signatures using `fuel.signMessage`.

<CodeImport file="../examples/SignMessage.tsx" lineStart={20} lineEnd={23} />

<Examples.SignMessage />

## Transfering assets

To transfer an amount to other address is very simple, you just need to use the `wallet.transfer` method passing the address you want to send and the amount

<CodeImport file="../examples/Transfer.tsx" lineStart={31} lineEnd={39} />

<Examples.Transfer />
