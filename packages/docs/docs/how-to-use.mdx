# How to use

<ConnectionAlert />

If you've correctly installed the Fuel wallet extension, the wallet SDK will be injected automatically on the `window` object on the property `fuel`. To access it, you can use `window.fuel`

```ts
window.fuel.connect();
```

You can try this code directly in the developer console.

## Detect when fuel is loaded

It's possible that your application loads before `window.fuel` is injected. To detect when the `fuel` is loaded and ready to use, you can listen to the event `FuelLoaded` on the document.
If you are using react take a look on the source code of the example bellow to see how we implement it.

<CodeImport file="../examples/FuelLoaded.tsx" lineStart="10" lineEnd="21" />

<Examples.FuelLoaded />

## Request connection

First, you need to request a connection with the wallet, which will authorize your application to execute other actions. You can do this by accessing `fuel.connect()`.

<CodeImport file="../examples/Connect.tsx" />

The `connect()` method returns a promise. If you prefer to do it in an async way, you can use `fuel.on('connection', () => void)` to
listen for changes in the connection.

<Examples.Connect />

## List user accounts

Once the connection is authorized, you can list the user accounts using `window.fuel.accounts()`.

<CodeImport file="../examples/ListAccounts.tsx" />

<Examples.ListAccounts />

## Get current account

You can also get the current account being used in the wallet using `window.fuel.currentAccount()`.

<CodeImport file="../examples/CurrentAccount.tsx" />

<Examples.CurrentAccount />

## Signing a message

With access to the user address and the connection authorized, you can request the user's signature using `fuel.signMessage`.

<CodeImport file="../examples/SignMessage.tsx" />

<Examples.SignMessage />

## Transfering assets

To transfer an amount to other address, use the `wallet.transfer` method and pass in the address you want to send to and the amount to send.

<CodeImport file="../examples/Transfer.tsx" />

<Examples.Transfer />

## Listening to events

To listen to events, you can use the `fuel.on` method. <br />
The first parameter is the event name and the second is the callback function. <br/ >
The events enum `FuelWalletEvents` can be imported from the `@fuel-wallet/sdk` package.

### Connection

To listen to connection events, you can use the `FuelWalletEvents.CONNECTION` event.

<CodeImport file="../src/hooks/useIsConnected.tsx" lineStart="9" lineEnd="27" />
<Examples.Events.Connection />

### Accounts

To listen to accounts events, you can use the `FuelWalletEvents.ACCOUNTS` event.

<CodeImport
  file="../examples/events/Accounts.tsx"
  lineStart="23"
  lineEnd="33"
/>
<Examples.Events.Accounts />

### Current Account

To listen to current account events, you can use the `FuelWalletEvents.CURRENT_ACCOUNT` event.

<CodeImport
  file="../examples/events/CurrentAccount.tsx"
  lineStart="23"
  lineEnd="35"
/>

<Examples.Events.CurrentAccount />

### Network Change

To listen to network events, you can use the `FuelWalletEvents.NETWORK` event.

<CodeImport file="../examples/events/Network.tsx" lineStart="27" lineEnd="38" />

Switch the network in your wallet to see the event triggered.

<Examples.Events.Network />
