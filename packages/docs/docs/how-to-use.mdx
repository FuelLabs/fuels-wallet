# How to use

<ConnectionAlert />

If you've correctly installed the Fuel wallet extension, the wallet SDK will be injected automatically on the `window` object on the property `fuel`. To access it, you can use `window.fuel`

```ts
window.fuel.connect();
```

You can try this code directly in the developer console.

## Detect when fuel is loaded

It's possible that your application loads before `window.fuel` is injected. To detect when the `fuel` is loaded and ready to use, you can listen to the event `FuelLoaded` on the document.
If you are using react take a look on the source code of the example bellow to see how we implement it.

<CodeImport file="../examples/FuelLoaded.tsx" lineStart="10" lineEnd="21" />

<Examples.FuelLoaded />

## Request connection

First, you need to request a connection with the wallet, which will authorize your application to execute other actions. You can do this by accessing `fuel.connect()`.

<CodeImport file="../examples/Connect.tsx" lineStart="15" lineEnd="16" />

The `connect()` method returns a promise. If you prefer to do it in an async way, you can use `fuel.on('connection', () => void)` to
listen for changes in the connection.

<Examples.Connect />

## List user accounts

Once the connection is authorized, you can list the user accounts using `window.fuel.accounts()`.

<CodeImport file="../examples/ListAccounts.tsx" lineStart="18" lineEnd="19" />

<Examples.ListAccounts />

## Get current account

You can also get the current account being used in the wallet using `window.fuel.currentAccount()`.

<CodeImport file="../examples/CurrentAccount.tsx" lineStart="18" lineEnd="19" />

<Examples.CurrentAccount />

## Signing a message

With access to the user address and the connection authorized, you can request the user's signature using `fuel.signMessage`.

<CodeImport file="../examples/SignMessage.tsx" lineStart="20" lineEnd="24" />

<Examples.SignMessage />

## Transfering assets

To transfer an amount to other address, use the `wallet.transfer` method and pass in the address you want to send to and the amount to send.

<CodeImport file="../examples/Transfer.tsx" lineStart="36" lineEnd="41" />

<Examples.Transfer />
