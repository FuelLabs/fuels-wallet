# How to use

<ConnectionAlert />

If you've correctly installed the Fuel wallet extension, the wallet SDK will be injected automatically on the `window` object on the property `fuel`. To access it, you can use `window.fuel`

```ts
window.fuel.connect();
```

You can try this code directly in the developer console.

## Request connection

First, you need to request a connection with the wallet, which will authorize your application to execute other actions. You can do this by accessing `fuel.connect()`.

```ts
const isConnected = await window.fuel.connect();
console.log("Connection response", isConnected);
```

The `connect()` method returns a promise. If you prefer to do it in an async way, you can use `fuel.on('connection', () => void)` to
listen for changes in the connection.

## List user accounts

Once the connection is authorized, you can list the user accounts using `window.fuel.accounts()`.

```ts
const accounts = await window.fuel.accounts();
console.log(accounts);
```

<Examples.ListAccounts />

## Signing a message

With access to the user address and the connection authorized, you can request the user's signature using `fuel.signMessage`.

```ts
const account = "fuel1<address>"; // example account
const signedMessage = await window.fuel.signMessage(account, message);
```

<Examples.SignMessage />

## Transfering assets

To transfer an amount to other address, use the `wallet.transfer` method and pass in the address you want to send to and the amount to send.

```ts
const accounts = await window.fuel.accounts();
const account = accounts[0];
const wallet = window.fuel.getWallet(account);
const toAddress = Address.fromString(
  "fuel1r3u2qfn00cgwk3u89uxuvz5cgcjaq934cfer6cwuew0424cz5sgq4yldul"
);

const response = await wallet.transfer(toAddress, amount);
```
