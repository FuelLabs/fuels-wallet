# TypeScript

The Fuel Wallet SDK provides a package on npm, making it more convenient to use in TypeScript projects.
To use it, you must also install the [`fuels`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fuels) package as a dependency.

## Installation

```bash
npm install fuels @fuel-wallet/sdk
```

## Usage

To use the SDK in your TypeScript project, add the following line to your tsconfig.json file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["@fuel-wallet/sdk"]
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can use a [TypeScript reference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/triple-slash-directives.html) directive in any TypeScript file:

```ts
/// <reference types="@fuel-wallet/sdk" />
```

## Example

With the SDK imported, `fuel` will be conveniently typed and accessible on the `window` object.

```ts
window.fuel?.connect();
```
