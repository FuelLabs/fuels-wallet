# React

To more easily work with the Fuel wallet in a React app, you can add a couple of helpful hooks.

## useFuel

Below is the code for a `useFuel` hook, which detects the Fuel Wallet in the browser window and returns it if found.

Make sure you have updated your `tsconfig.json` file as shown in the [TypeScript](/docs/typescript) section to use this hook.

<CodeImport file="../src/hooks/useFuel.tsx" />

Here is how you can use the `useFuel` hook in a component:

<CodeImport
  file="../examples/events/Accounts.tsx"
  lineStart="11"
  lineEnd="11"
/>

## useIsConnected

The `useIsConnected` hook checks if a user's wallet is connected to your app.
This hook depends on the `useFuel` hook above.

<CodeImport file="../src/hooks/useIsConnected.tsx" />

Here is how you can use the `useIsConnected` hook in a component:

<CodeImport
  file="../examples/events/Accounts.tsx"
  lineStart="13"
  lineEnd="13"
/>
