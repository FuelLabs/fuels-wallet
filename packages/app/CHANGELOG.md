  This led to wrong account addresses generation, as updates to the `IndexedDB` didn't reflect in the Wallet Manager's internal state, particularly the `#vaults` property.

  To resolve this issue, I implemented a manual call to `removeVault` during logout.

  This ensures that each new wallet generated starts from scratch, free from interference by any previous mnemonic vault.
