"fuels-wallet": patch
---

- Re-enabled E2E contract tests
- Fixed biome trying to validate files generated by playwright test runs
- Fixed Playwright tests starting up before CRX files are available, now runs `build` beforehand.
- Fixed CRX dev server reloading during playwright tests, causing instabilities
- Fixed NODE_ENV being set to default (production) on local E2E tests, leading to the wrong version (i.e. production) being installed
- Fixed bug where only the first test file in a suite run would use the local CRX build, it'd then download and use a production build of the Wallet for the rest
